# Welcome to the Playground!

This repo was made to allow anyone who has access to it a playground to experiment with things in Unity.

The idea is that no matter what you do, whether it's programming, creating assets, designing, and so on, you can freely use what's in the repo to make and experiment with anything you want. Instead of being worried about not having assets or resources, you can hopefully find what you need here. This also provides a collaborative environment where you can interact with other members of the organization to discuss and work together to make things happen.

The one thing to note is that under no circumstance should the work and assets found here be sold without the approval of the original creator. This is meant to be a place to develop your skills, not an easy way to make money. Please respect everyone.
